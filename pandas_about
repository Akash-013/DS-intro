Introduction to Pandas
Pandas is a widely-used Python library built on top of NumPy. Much of the rest of this course will be dedicated to learning about pandas and how it is used in the 
world of finance.

What is Pandas?
Pandas is a Python library created by Wes McKinney, who built pandas to help work with datasets in Python for his work in finance at his place of employment.
According to the library’s website, pandas is “a fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use open source data analysis and manipulation tool, built on top of the 
Python programming language.”
Pandas stands for ‘panel data’. Note that pandas is typically stylized as an all-lowercase word, although it is considered a best practice to capitalize its first 
letter at the beginning of sentences.
Pandas is an open source library, which means that anyone can view its source code and make suggestions using pull requests. If you are curious about this, visit 
the pandas source code repository on GitHub

The Main Benefit of Pandas
Pandas was designed to work with two-dimensional data (similar to Excel spreadsheets). Just as the NumPy library had a built-in data structure called an array 
with special attributes and methods, the pandas library has a built-in two-dimensional data structure called a DataFrame.

What Are Pandas Series?
Series are a special type of data structure available in the pandas Python library. Pandas Series are similar to NumPy arrays, except that we can give them a named 
or datetime index instead of just a numerical index.

The Main Advantage of Pandas Series Over NumPy Arrays
While we didn’t encounter it at the time, NumPy arrays are highly limited by one characteristic: every element of a NumPy array must be the same type of data structure. 
Said differently, NumPy array elements must be all string, or all integers, or all booleans - you get the point.
Pandas Series do not suffer from this limitation. In fact, pandas Series are highly flexible.

Pandas DataFrames
NumPy allows developers to work with both one-dimensional NumPy arrays (sometimes called vectors) and two-dimensional NumPy arrays (sometimes called matrices). 
We explored pandas Series in the last section, which are similar to one-dimensional NumPy arrays.
In this section, we will dive into pandas DataFrames, which are similar to two-dimensional NumPy arrays - but with much more functionality. DataFrames are the most 
important data structure in the pandas library, so pay close attention throughout this section.

What Is A Pandas DataFrame?
A pandas DataFrame is a two-dimensional data structure that has labels for both its rows and columns. For those familiar with Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, or 
other spreadsheet software, DataFrames are very similar.
